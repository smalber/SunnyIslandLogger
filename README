SMysqLogger - a MySql logger for SMA Sunny Island 5048 inverters

This project was written to monitor a solar production site using a SMA inverter.
It consists of:
 * a logger part written in C and running on a Synology NAS. It sits under /yasdi/logger
 * a web user interface written in PHP. It sits under /web
 
The two parts are completely independant and just target the same database.

Requirements (included):

The logger part requires:
* YASDI, the SMA library implementing exchange protocol with the inverter. Copyright(C) 2001-2008 SMA Solar Technology AG

The UI part requires:
* JQuery jQuery JavaScript Library. Copyright 2011, John Resig
* jQuery UI. Copyright 2011, AUTHORS.txt (http://jqueryui.com/about)
* Highcharts JS, a graph rendering library in Javascript. Copyright(c) 2009-2010 Torstein HÃ¸nsi
